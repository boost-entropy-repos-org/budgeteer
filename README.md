### Configuring localhost for HTTPS

You need to configure your browser to trust a self-generated HTTPs certificate, because this project uses gRPC over HTTP/2.

macOS: run `make install-certs-mac`.

For Windows or Linux, run `make certs` to generate the required certificates, then install them in your default browser.
